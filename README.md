## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
In Deliverable 1, we read in the Mechacar_mpg file as a dataframe, which contains 50 different Mechacar prototypes and multiple different metrics. We then performed a linear regression, passing through all the different metrics and adding in our dataframe. Lastly, we used the summary function to calculate the 'p' and 'r' values for our model.

* Vehicle_length and ground_clearance were the two metrics that would provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg, as they had the highest P and T values. 

* The slope of the linear model would not be 0. Our p value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than .05%. This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. 

* The r squared value of our linear model was 0.7149, or 71% accuracy. For the purposes of this analysis, we can say this model does predict mpg accurately.
